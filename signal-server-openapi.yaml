      summary: Perform an attested action
      description: |
        Specify some action to take on the account via the request field. The request must exactly match the request you
        provide when [generating the assertion](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/dcappattestservice/generateassertion(_:clientdatahash:completionhandler:)).
        The request must include a challenge previously retrieved from `GET /v1/devicecheck/assert`.

        Each assertion increments the counter associated with the client's device key. This method enforces that no
        assertion with a counter lower than a counter we've already seen is allowed to execute. If a client issues
        multiple requests concurrently, or if they retry a request that had an indeterminate outcome, it's possible that
        the request will not be accepted because the server has already stored the updated counter. In this case the
        request may return 401, and the client should generate a fresh assert for the request.

      summary: Create receipt credentials
      description: |
        Create a receipt from a valid payment invoice that can be used to obtain an entitlement

        This request is repeatable so long as the ReceiptCredentialRequest remains the same. Clients should use the same
        ReceiptCredentialRequest value until they attempt to redeem the resulting ReceiptCredentialPresentation. After
        this point, the ReceiptCredentialRequest MUST NOT be reused or you may not be able to redeem a valid payment
        invoice. Clients SHOULD retry requests at this endpoint with the same ReceiptCredentialRequest value until
        receiving a response. After receiving a response, clients should then compute the ReceiptCredentialPresentation
        and redeem it at the receipt redemption endpoint. Once the first attempt is made there, the same
        ReceiptCredentialRequest MUST NOT be used again to request receipt credentials.

        Note that you may in fact redeem TWO or more invoices for the same ReceiptCredentialRequest while retrying this
        operation if a later invoice gets paid while you are retrying. However, the returned receipt is always for the
        latest invoice, so it will have the latest expiration possible and no entitlement time will be lost. The important
        thing is not to reuse ReceiptCredentialRequest after you have started attempting to redeem the associated
        ReceiptCredentialPresentation. Then you may produce a ReceiptCredentialPresentation for a later invoice that
        cannot be redeemed.

        Clients MUST validate that the generated receipt credential's level and expiration matches their expectations.

        Set a purchaseToken that represents an IAP subscription made with Google Play Billing.

        To set up a subscription with Google Play Billing:
        1. Create a subscriber with `PUT subscriptions/{subscriberId}` (you must regularly refresh this subscriber)
        2. [Create a subscription](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate) with Google Play Billing
           directly and obtain a purchaseToken. Do not [acknowledge](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#subscriptions)
           the purchaseToken.
        3. `POST` the purchaseToken here
        4. Obtain a receipt at `POST /v1/subscription/{subscriberId}/receipt_credentials` which can then be used to obtain the
           entitlement

        After calling this method, the payment is confirmed. Callers must durably store their subscriberId before calling
        this method to ensure their payment is tracked.

        Once a purchaseToken to is posted to a subscriberId, the same subscriberId must not be used with another payment
        method. A different playbilling purchaseToken can be posted to the same subscriberId, in this case the subscription
        associated with the old purchaseToken will be cancelled.

          Meaningfully interpreting chargeFailure response fields requires inspecting the processor field first.

          For Stripe, code will be one of the [codes defined here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/object#charge_object-failure_code),
          while message [may contain a further textual description](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/object#charge_object-failure_message).
          The outcome fields are nullable, but present values will directly map to Stripe [response properties](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome-network_status)

          For Braintree, the outcome fields will be null. The code and message will contain one of
            - a processor decline code (as a string) in code, and associated text in message, as defined this [table](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/general/processor-responses/authorization-responses)
            - `gateway` in code, with a [reason](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/transactions/gateway-rejections) in message
            - `code` = "unknown", message = "unknown"

          IAP payment processors will never include charge failure information, and detailed order information should be
          retrieved from the payment processor directly
